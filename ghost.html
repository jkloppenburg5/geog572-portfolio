                    Top of mind for most cyclists in the presence of motor vehicles is safety.  The Wisconsin DMV was quite helpful in providing crash statistics from 2022 which allowed 
                    me to investigate this topic in Wisconsin.  Given that most cyclist injuries are the result of incidents involving motor vehicles, it made sense to normalize enumerated 
                    incidents by registered motor vehicle operators in each county (opposed to area, population, etc.).  
                    This isn't perfect - perhaps some registered drivers don't drive much - but it does produce some interesting results.  
                    One of the key utilities that maps provide to us is visual pattern recognition.  This choropleth map delivered, in that we can spot some interesting (problematic?) groupings.  
                    One thing that surprised me a bit was that even with normalization-by-registered-driver, counties with high population density still showed up as problematic.  
                    Perhaps there is another variable that can be identified.
